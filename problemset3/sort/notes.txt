How can i reason which algoritm is which with runtime cases. 


**this file has nothing to do with the time it takes to run, for a lack of better term deciding what cases to run on each algorithm and why.

just realised that running on sorted wont work or return a case verifiable case instead it just runs through the dataset. 

Selection Sorting 

- best case running on sorted 5000 
- worst case running on random sorted 50000 

Bubble Sorting
